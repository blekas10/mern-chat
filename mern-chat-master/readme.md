This backend code is a Node.js server using the Express.js framework, along with other libraries such as Mongoose, WebSocket, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and Bcrypt. It provides functionalities for user registration, login, logout, profile management, and a real-time chat system with file sharing. Let's break down the code in detail:

Importing required packages:

express: Express.js framework for creating the server.
mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
cookie-parser: Middleware for parsing cookies.
dotenv: Package for loading environment variables from a .env file.
jsonwebtoken (JWT): JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
bcryptjs: Library for hashing and comparing passwords.
ws: WebSocket library for real-time communication.
fs: Built-in Node.js filesystem library.
Loading environment variables and connecting to MongoDB.

Configuring the Express application:

Serving static files from the 'uploads' folder.
Using JSON, cookie-parser, and CORS middlewares.
Defining helper functions:

getUserDataFromRequest: Extracts user data from the JWT token in the request.
Defining the API routes:

/test: Returns a simple test response.
/messages/:userId: Fetches messages between the logged-in user and the user with the specified ID.
/people: Fetches the list of all registered users.
/profile: Fetches the profile data of the logged-in user.
/login: Handles user login by verifying credentials and setting a JWT token as a cookie.
/logout: Handles user logout by clearing the JWT token cookie.
/register: Handles user registration by creating a new user and setting a JWT token as a cookie.
Starting the HTTP server with the Express application.

Setting up WebSocket server (wss) for real-time communication:

Listening for new connections and managing connection life using a heartbeat mechanism (ping-pong).
Handling authentication and associating the connection with user data.
Handling incoming messages and broadcasting them to the intended recipient.
Notifying all connected clients about the list of online users when someone connects or disconnects.
In summary, this backend code provides a foundation for a real-time chat application with user authentication and file sharing functionality. Users can register, login, view profiles, chat with other users, and share files using the provided API routes and WebSocket server.

 This frontend code is a React application that uses Axios for API requests, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Vite as the build tool and development server. The application consists of an App component, a RegisterAndLoginForm component, and a UserContext for managing user data. Here is an explanation of the code:

App component:

Imports axios, UserContextProvider, and Routes.
Sets the default base URL for Axios requests to the backend server and enables sending cookies.
Wraps the Routes component with the UserContextProvider to provide user data throughout the application.
RegisterAndLoginForm component:

Imports required hooks, Axios, UserContext, and an image.
Uses useState to manage the state of username, password, and isLoginOrRegister.
Uses useContext to access the setUsername and setId methods from the UserContext.
Defines the handleSubmit function to handle form submission, making an API request to either register or log in the user, and updating the UserContext with the logged-in user's data.
Renders a form with input fields for the username and password, a submit button, and buttons to switch between login and register forms. The form is styled using Tailwind CSS classes, and a background image is set for half of the screen.
package.json:

Defines the name, version, type, and scripts for the project.
Lists the dependencies and devDependencies required for the project, such as React, React DOM, Axios, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
In summary, this frontend code provides a simple React application with a register/login form. Users can enter their credentials and either register or log in, depending on their choice. The application uses Axios to communicate with the backend server, React Context for managing user data, and Tailwind CSS for styling the components.
